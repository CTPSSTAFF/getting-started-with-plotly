# getting-started-with-plotly

This repository is devoted to getting you started creating data visualizations with the [plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) library.
It describes what you'll need to work with plotly, offers instructions on creating your first visualization
with plotly (and tweaking it!), and provides "templates" for the most common types of visualizations 
that you can copy and modify.

Start by reading and walking through the instructions in the GETTING_STARTED.md document in this repo.

Have fun!
