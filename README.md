# getting-started-with-plotly

This repository is devoted to getting you started creating data visualizations with the plotly.js library.
It describes what you'll need to work with plotly, offers instructions on creating your first visualization
with plotly (and tweaking it!), and provides "templates" for the most common types of visualizations 
that you can copy and modify.

Have fun!
